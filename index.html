# Hey 👋, I'm RuixiangYe!

### Here is my self introduction

I received my B.Sc. in Chemistry and Theoretical Physics from Zhejiang Normal University in 2025. I am currently preparing to begin my career as a high school chemistry teacher. My academic interests lie primarily in theoretical chemistry and theoretical physics, with a particular focus on areas where physics intersects with differential geometry and algebraic topology. Outside of teaching and research, I have a strong appreciation for classical music, coffee, and table tennis. While education is my main profession, I remain actively engaged in independent research in my spare time. ☺️☺️☺️

During my undergraduate studies, in addition to the core curriculum in chemistry, I completed the four fundamental mechanics courses from the undergraduate physics program and took graduate-level courses in Quantum Field Theory (too difficult to learn!), General Relativity, and Many-Body Physics. From the mathematics department, I studied Group Theory (the most beautiful!), Differential Geometry, and Algebraic Topology. I am also skilled in programming, with practical experience in numerical computation using Python and Mathematica. 😉😉😉

My previous research involved topics such as quantum geometry in strongly correlated systems—including the anisotropic quantum Hall effect—as well as topological phases and fractionalization. In theoretical chemistry, I worked on applications of density functional theory (DFT); a related publication can be found here: [j.jcis.2023.05.041](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979723008329).
I have since shifted my focus away from these research areas. 😇😇😇

In addition, I actively share science communication content and study notes on Zhihu, a leading knowledge-sharing platform in China, where my [posts](https://www.zhihu.com/people/he-xi-7-18-54) have accumulated over 400,000 views. 🤪🤪🤪
